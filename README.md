# Course requirements
The requirements for passing the course are DataCamp assignments (5pts), the midterm (25pts), work in-progress-presentation (10pts), and the final project - including the final delivery presentation (60pts).
At least 50% from the DataCamp assignments and work-in-progress presentation is required for passing the course.

## Final project (60%)
* Students in teams by 2
* The task is to download any data from API or directly from the web. These data should be processed and visualized in the Jupyter Notebook, with auxiliary scripts consisting of functions and classes definitions as .py files. The project should be submitted as a GitHub repository.
* The selection of the data is up to the students. (Conditional on our approval.)
* Git collaboration as a proof of collaboration of both students.
* More details during the lecture.

See example project from the previous semesters [here](https://github.com/vitekzkytek/Example_Project) from last year.

## Project work - presentation (10%)
* Presentation of work-in-progress related to the final project.

## Midterm exam (25%)
23/11. Live coding (80 minutes), "open browser", no collaboration between the students. More details during the lecture week before

 # Prerequisities
 Econometrics II. (JEB110) is an explicit prerequisite for bachelor students.

 The course is designed for students that have at least some basic coding experience. It does not need to be very advanced, but they should be aware of concepts such as ` for ` loop ,`if` and `else`,`variable` or `function`.

 No knowledge of Python is required for entering the course.

 # Credits
 Passing the course is rewarded with 5 ECTS credits.
