    "## Bubble Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept\n",
    "Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, \n",
    "compares each pair of adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. \n",
    "The process is repeated until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process\n",
    "1. **Start at the beginning** of the list.\n",
    "2. **Compare the first two elements**. If the first is greater than the second, swap them.\n",
    "3. **Move to the next pair** of elements, repeat the comparison and swap if necessary.\n",
    "4. Continue this process for each pair of adjacent elements until the end of the list.\n",
    "5. After each pass, the largest unsorted element is correctly placed at the end.\n",
    "6. **Repeat** these steps for the remaining list (excluding the last sorted elements).\n",
    "7. The sorting is complete when a pass requires no swaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - **Best Case**: O(n) when the list is already sorted.\n",
    "  - **Worst Case**: O(n^2) when the list is sorted in reverse order.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as it only requires a small, constant amount of additional space.\n",
    "- **Stability**: Bubble Sort is stable, meaning it preserves the order of equal elements.\n",
    "- **Adaptability**: It can adapt to a situation where the list is already sorted, making it efficient in such cases.\n"
